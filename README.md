[Fastest](#speed) JS implementation of BLS12-381. Auditable, secure, 0-dependency aggregated signatures & pairings.

The pairing-friendly Barreto-Lynn-Scott elliptic curve construction allows to:

- Construct [zk-SNARKs](https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/) at the 128-bit security
- Use [threshold signatures](https://medium.com/snigirev.stepan/bls-signatures-better-than-schnorr-5a7fe30ea716),
  which allows a user to sign lots of messages with one signature and verify them swiftly in a batch,
  using Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signature scheme.

Compatible with Algorand, Chia, Dfinity, ETH, FIL, ZEC. Matches specs [pairing-curves-10](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-pairing-friendly-curves-10), [bls-sigs-04](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-bls-signature-04), [hash-to-curve-12](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-12).
